This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: accessing an element in a vector using an index that is out of bounds. The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access the third element of a vector containing only two elements. This results in a runtime panic. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version of the code that avoids this error by using safe indexing methods like `.get()` or checking bounds beforehand.  This example highlights the importance of careful error handling and bounds checking when working with vectors in Rust.
